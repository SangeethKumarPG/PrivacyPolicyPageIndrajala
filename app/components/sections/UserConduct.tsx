                At Indrajala Movie Makers LLP, we are committed to providing a safe, enjoyable, and respectful environment for all users on our OTT platform. To maintain the integrity of our content and protect the rights of our creators and users, we have established this comprehensive User Conduct Policy.

                Our policy aims to ensure fair usage of our platform while safeguarding the interests of all stakeholders, including content creators, intellectual property owners, and users. We believe in fostering an environment where everyone can freely enjoy our fantasy content without fear of misuse or unauthorized distribution.

                    <p>
                        Users are not allowed to record any content available on the Indrajala platform, including making video recordings, audio recordings, or any form of capturing content for personal or public use. Recording our content without permission violates our copyright and intellectual property rights and may lead to legal action.

                    <p>
                        We understand the desire to share memorable moments from our fantasy series, but recording the content infringes on the rights of our creators and compromises the exclusivity of our offerings. Our platform is designed to provide a seamless viewing experience, and recording would disrupt this intent.

                        Taking screenshots of any content on our platform and sharing them on the internet or through any other means is strictly prohibited. Sharing screenshots can lead to unauthorized distribution of our materials and compromises the integrity of our offerings. Users must respect our intellectual property rights and refrain from disseminating any part of our content.

                    <p>
                        While we encourage users to engage with our content and share their excitement with others, sharing screenshots or clips on social media or other platforms without permission is not allowed. This protects the exclusivity of our content and ensures that our creators receive the recognition and compensation they deserve for their work.
