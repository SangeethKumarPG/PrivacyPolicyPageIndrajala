                Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet) by websites and applications you visit. They are widely used to make websites work efficiently, enhance user experience, and provide functionality. Cookies help websites remember your actions and preferences over time, such as login details, language preferences, and display settings, so you don&apos;t have to re-enter them each time you visit.

                There are different types of cookies, including:

                Session Cookies: These are temporary cookies that expire once you close your browser. They are used to remember your actions during a single browsing session.
                Persistent Cookies: These cookies remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them. They are used to remember your preferences and settings across multiple sessions.
                First-Party Cookies: Set by the website you are visiting, these cookies can be used to remember your preferences and improve your experience on that site.
                Third-Party Cookies: Set by domains other than the one you are visiting, these cookies are often used for tracking and advertising purposes.
