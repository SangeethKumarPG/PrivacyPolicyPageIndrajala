            <h4 className="text-xl font-semi-bold p-2">User&apos;s Right for Cancellation</h4>
            <p>
                Users have the complete right to cancel their accounts, discontinue any payments, and opt out of automatic renewals associated with Indrajala LLP and its services. It is emphasized that the use of Indrajala’s services is entirely voluntary, meaning that no user or individual is obligated to maintain their account or continue utilizing the platform. The cancellation process is designed to be straightforward, allowing users to easily navigate the necessary steps within their profiles. Should users encounter any difficulties while attempting to navigate the cancellation process, they are encouraged to reach out for assistance by emailing itsupport@indrajala.in. This support channel is available to provide guidance and resolve any issues users may face, ensuring a seamless experience when exercising their rights regarding account cancellation and payment discontinuation. Indrajala is committed to providing clear and accessible options for users to manage their accounts according to their preferences.


                While cancellations are entirely at the discretion of the user, and Indrajala fully supports their choice, it is important to note that the company does not provide refunds upon cancellation of a profile. Users will not be eligible for any refunds from Indrajala in connection with account cancellations. Furthermore, the company will not entertain any requests for refunds related to the cancellation of user profiles. This policy ensures clarity regarding the financial implications of canceling an account, allowing users to make informed decisions while understanding that any fees paid prior to cancellation are non-refundable. Indrajala is committed to maintaining transparency about its cancellation and refund policies to prevent any misunderstandings.


                It is crucial to recognize that the cancellation process is non-revisable; once a user cancels their account, they cannot request reinstatement, and access to the platform will only be possible through renewal of their profile under a new subscription plan. Therefore, users are strongly encouraged to rethink their decision before proceeding with the cancellation, as it entails the permanent loss of access to the content associated with their account. Additionally, accounts will automatically be canceled upon the expiration of the selected subscription plan if the user fails to renew it. In such scenarios, users must renew to a valid plan to regain access to the platform and its offerings. This policy highlights the importance of being aware of the account&apos;s status and subscription timelines, ensuring users have the necessary information to make informed decisions about their subscriptions and prevent any unintended disruptions to their viewing experience. Indrajala is committed to providing clear communication about these policies to help users navigate their account management effectively.

            <h4 className="text-xl font-semi-bold p-2">Refunds Regarding Subscription Cancellations</h4>
            <p>
                Users have the freedom to cancel their subscriptions at any time and are not obligated to renew them. However, please be aware that if an active user chooses to cancel their subscription or delete their account for any reason, they will not be eligible for a refund.


                We strongly recommend that users review the Account Deletion Page before proceeding with the deletion of their profile. This page contains important information regarding the implications of account deletion and the cancellation process. Thank you for your understanding.
